I want the old layer and yet it is both currently a bit useless and a massive danger to security. 

in normal use you should not use the old layer:
decrypt the link layer to get the links, download files
decrypt axx layer with big pass 2 times, 
decrpyt smaller layers with old passes 

the instruction for it are:
Public layer - AxLayer - 2015 pass 2 times
Outer layer - long password - 2014 pass	- 2015 pass 1 times (change it to a 2013 version but in 2015 style when you upload new files (after EN7))
Inner later 2 - 2013 pass - p0
Inner layer - short password - 2012 pass

and you are done.

But if you are an idiot and need to know what the 4 passes are and how they change, you need this security weakness. 

as a result however this file should also be encrpyted hard:

3 7zip layers with an axx layer between them, all with different passes: you just try the right one for each layer but q1-p0-q21 is a hint
The axx layer is a standart big pass 2 times. 

YES THAT IS A LOT OF LAYERS, BUT IF THIS SH*T IS BREACHED, SO IS ALL THE SECURITY.
