Security:
All files are public but heavily encrypted using the old method. All files are just links to encypted files. 

4 layers of encryption using 2 different programs and 4 different passes for each layer. Link layer is just a normal 2012 pass usigng 3 different characters. 
link names should be encrypted but if they are not .... a 5th layer should be added with 2008 pass.
